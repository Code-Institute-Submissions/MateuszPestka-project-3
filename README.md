# **Tic Tac Toe**

I have decided to make a Tic Tac Toe game as my third project using python. This game allows two users to play a game of Tic Tac Toe agianst each other.
The game is a two player game. A player wins by lining up three X's or three O's in a row either horizontally, diagonally or vertically.
